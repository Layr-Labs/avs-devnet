# EigenLayer AVS Devnet

*AvsDevnet* is a CLI tool and library to start highly customizable local devnets.
The CLI tool is used in place of bash scripts for end-to-end testing and local development.
The library, on the other hand, is commonly used in place of mocks for automated testing of specific situations.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, only the [Kurtosis package](./kurtosis_package/) and [CLI](./cli/) are available.
> Future versions may include the testing library.

## Dependencies

Since the Devnet is implemented as a Kurtosis package, we require Kurtosis to be installed.
For how to install it, you can check [here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/).
As part of that, you'll also need to install Docker.

For deploying local contracts, [foundry needs to be installed](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
Also, only contracts inside foundry projects are supported as of now.

For development, we require [the `go` toolchain to be installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To be able to [install the CLI via `go`](#installation), you'll need to add `$HOME/go/bin` to your `PATH`.
> You can do so by adding to your `~/.bashrc` (or the equivalent for your shell) the following line:
>
> ```bash
> export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
> ```

## Installation

To build and install the CLI locally, run:

```sh
make deps      # installs dependencies
make install   # installs the project
```

## How to Use

### Creating a devnet config

This will create a new devnet config.
By default it's stored as `devnet.yaml`, but another name can be passed as parameter.

```sh
devnet init
```

The default configuration deploys EigenLayer with a single strategy and operator.
It also starts up a [blockscout explorer](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout).

### Starting the devnet

This will start a devnet according to the configuration inside `devnet.yaml`.
Another file name can be specified as the first parameter.

```sh
devnet start
```

Note that only one devnet per file name can be running at the same time.
Trying to start another one (or the same one more than once) will fail.

### Stopping the devnet

This will stop the devnet according to the configuration inside `devnet.yaml`.
Another file name can be specified as the first parameter.

```sh
devnet stop
```

### Fetching the address of a contract

This will output the address of the deployed contract named `delegation`, from the artifact `eigenlayer_addresses`.
In the default configuration, this corresponds to the address of EigenLayer's `DelegationManager`.

```sh
$ devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:delegation
0x9f9F5Fd89ad648f2C000C954d8d9C87743243eC5
```

This works by parsing the JSON artifacts generated by the deployment scripts.
The command expects there to be a single file with a field called "addresses" under which addresses are listed.

More examples:

```sh
# print all addresses in eigenlayer_addresses artifact
$ devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:
{
  "addresses": {
    # ...
    "delegation": "0x9f9F5Fd89ad648f2C000C954d8d9C87743243eC5",
    # ...
    "strategies": {
      "MockETH": "0x2b45cD38B213Bbd3A1A848bf2467927c976877Cb"
    },
    # ...
  },
  # ...
}
# print the address under strategies -> MockETH
$ devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:strategies.MockETH
0x2b45cD38B213Bbd3A1A848bf2467927c976877Cb
# because we also search nested entries, the last one can be shortened to
$ devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:MockETH
0x2b45cD38B213Bbd3A1A848bf2467927c976877Cb
# by adding a . at the start, we disable the search function
$ devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:.MockETH  # this fails
Contract not found: eigenlayer_addresses:.MockETH
```

### Local development

Some fields in the config can be used to ease deployment of local projects.

The `repo` field in `deployments` accepts local paths.
This can be used when deployments should be done from locally available versions.

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: some-deployment
    repo: "foo/bar/baz"
```

The `build_context` field in `services`, if specified, allows the Devnet to automatically build docker images via `docker build`.
Images are built in the specified context, and tagged with the name specified in the `image` field.
If the build file is named something other than `Dockerfile`, or isn't located in the context, you can use `build_file` to specify the path.

```yaml
services:
  - name: my-service
    image: some-local-image-name
    build_context: path/to/context
    build_file: path/to/context/Dockerfile
```

### More Help

You can find the options for each command by appending `--help`:

```sh
$ devnet --help

   devnet - start an AVS devnet
