# EigenLayer AVS Devnet

*AvsDevnet* is a CLI tool and library to start highly customizable local devnets.
The CLI tool is used in place of bash scripts for end-to-end testing and local development.
The library, on the other hand, is commonly used in place of mocks for automated testing of specific situations.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, only the [Kurtosis package](./kurtosis_package/) and [CLI](./cli/) are available.
> Future versions may include the testing library.

## Dependencies

Since the Devnet is implemented as a Kurtosis package, we require Kurtosis to be installed.
For how to install it, you can check [here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/).
As part of that, you'll also need to install Docker.

For deploying local contracts, [foundry needs to be installed](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
Also, only contracts inside foundry projects are supported as of now.

For development, we require [the `go` toolchain to be installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## How to install

### Using `go` toolchain

To install the devnet using the `go` toolchain:

```sh
go install github.com/Layr-Labs/avs-devnet/cmd/avs-devnet@latest
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To be able to use the CLI when installed via `go`, you'll need to add `GOBIN` (by default `$HOME/go/bin`) to your `PATH`.
> You can do so by adding to your `~/.bashrc`, or the equivalent for your shell, the following line:
>
> ```bash
> export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
> ```
>
> More information [on the Go wiki](https://go.dev/wiki/GOPATH).

### With a local copy of the repo

To build and install the CLI with a local copy of the repo, first clone the repo, and then run:

```sh
make deps      # installs dependencies
make install   # installs the project
```

## How to Use

### Creating a devnet config

This will create a new devnet config.
By default it's stored as `devnet.yaml`, but another name can be passed as parameter.

```sh
avs-devnet init
```

The default configuration deploys EigenLayer with a single strategy and operator.
It also starts up a [blockscout explorer](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout).

### Starting the devnet

This will start a devnet according to the configuration inside `devnet.yaml`.
Another file name can be specified as the first parameter.

```sh
avs-devnet start
```

Note that only one devnet per file name can be running at the same time.
Trying to start another one (or the same one more than once) will fail.

### Stopping the devnet

This will stop the devnet according to the configuration inside `devnet.yaml`.
Another file name can be specified as the first parameter.

```sh
avs-devnet stop
```

### Fetching the address of a contract

This will output the address of the deployed contract named `delegation`, from the artifact `eigenlayer_addresses`.
In the default configuration, this corresponds to the address of EigenLayer's `DelegationManager`.

```sh
$ avs-devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:delegation
0x9f9F5Fd89ad648f2C000C954d8d9C87743243eC5
```

This works by parsing the JSON artifacts generated by the deployment scripts.
The command expects each artifact to be composed of a single JSON file with the addresses.

More examples:

```sh
# print all addresses in eigenlayer_addresses artifact
$ avs-devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:
{
  "addresses": {
    # ...
    "delegation": "0x9f9F5Fd89ad648f2C000C954d8d9C87743243eC5",
    # ...
    "strategies": {
      "MockETH": "0x2b45cD38B213Bbd3A1A848bf2467927c976877Cb"
    },
    # ...
  },
  # ...
}
# print the address under strategies -> MockETH
$ avs-devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:strategies.MockETH
0x2b45cD38B213Bbd3A1A848bf2467927c976877Cb
# because we also search nested entries, the last one can be shortened to
$ avs-devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:MockETH
0x2b45cD38B213Bbd3A1A848bf2467927c976877Cb
# by adding a . at the start, we disable the search function
$ avs-devnet get-address eigenlayer_addresses:.MockETH  # this fails
Contract not found: eigenlayer_addresses:.MockETH
```

### Fetching the ports of a service

This will output the ports exposed by each service, in YAML format.

```sh
$ avs-devnet get-ports
blockscout:
    http: 127.0.0.1:65055
blockscout-postgres:
    postgresql: 127.0.0.1:65049
blockscout-verif:
    http: 127.0.0.1:65050
cl-1-lighthouse-besu:
    http: 127.0.0.1:64999
    metrics: 127.0.0.1:65000
    tcp-discovery: 127.0.0.1:65001
    udp-discovery: 127.0.0.1:50739
el-1-besu-lighthouse:
    engine-rpc: 127.0.0.1:64862
    metrics: 127.0.0.1:64863
    rpc: 127.0.0.1:64865
    tcp-discovery: 127.0.0.1:64864
    udp-discovery: 127.0.0.1:55709
    ws: 127.0.0.1:64866
validator-key-generation-cl-validator-keystore: {}
vc-1-besu-lighthouse:
    metrics: 127.0.0.1:65048
```

## Advanced Features

### Local development

Some fields in the config can be used to ease deployment of local projects.
Under `examples/` we have some devnet configurations that follow this approach.

#### Deployment from local source

The `repo` field in `deployments` accepts local paths.
Use this to deploy from locally available versions.

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: incredible-squaring
    repo: "." # the directory where the devnet config file is in
```

#### Services with locally-built images

The `build_context` field in `services`, if specified, allows the Devnet to automatically build docker images via `docker build`.
Images are built in the specified context, and tagged with the name specified in the `image` field.
If the build file is named something other than `Dockerfile`, or isn't located in the context, you can use `build_file` to specify the path.

```yaml
services:
  - name: my-aggregator
    image: aggregator
    build_context: "dockerfiles/"
    build_file: "aggregator.Dockerfile"
```

For image builds requiring a custom command, you can use `build_cmd` to specify it.
This overrides the `build_context` and `build_file`.

```yaml
services:
  - name: my-aggregator
    image: aggregator
    build_cmd: "docker build . -t aggregator && touch .finished"
```

#### Static files

Static files can be made into a file artifact by using `static_file` in the `artifacts.<artifact-name>.files.<file-name>` section.

```yaml
artifacts:
  my_artifact:
    files:
      somefile.txt: "path/to/myfile.log"
```

### Plug and play examples

Devnet configurations can be made to run without any local dependencies.
In that case, running it is as easy as:

1. Install AvsDevnet
2. Download the devnet configuration to use as `devnet.yaml`
3. Run `avs-devnet start` in the same folder

Under `examples/` we have some devnet configurations that follow this approach.

#### Deployment from remote source

The `repo` field in `deployments` accepts any remote git repo URL.
This should be used for deployment of contracts not locally available.

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: incredible-squaring
    # URL taken from the clone option on GitHub
    repo: "https://github.com/Layr-Labs/incredible-squaring-avs.git"
```

#### Services with remote images

If no other option is specified (see [Services with locally-built images](#services-with-locally-built-images)), images will be.

```yaml
services:
  - name: my-aggregator
    image: aggregator
```

For image builds requiring a custom command, you can use `build_cmd` to specify it.
This overrides the `build_context` and `build_file`.

```yaml
services:
  - name: my-aggregator
    image: aggregator
    build_cmd: "docker build . -t aggregator && touch .finished"
```

#### Remote static files

Static files can be specified by an arbitrary URL.
The devnet will then send a GET HTTP request to fetch the file.

```yaml
artifacts:
  my_artifact:
    files:
      somefile.txt: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Layr-Labs/incredible-squaring-avs/refs/heads/master/README.md"
```

### Running multiple devnets

Some subcommands accepts a `--name`/`-n` parameter, which sets the devnet name to be used (the default is `devnet`).
By specifying different names, you can work with multiple devnets at the same time.

Example:

```sh
# Starts a devnet with name "devnet"
avs-devnet start
# Starts a devnet with name "foo"
avs-devnet start -n foo

# Gets the ports exposed by "devnet"
avs-devnet get-ports
# Gets the ports exposed by "foo"
avs-devnet get-ports -n foo

# Stops "devnet"
avs-devnet stop
# The next command fails because "devnet" is not running
avs-devnet get-ports
# This works
avs-devnet get-ports -n foo
```

### More Help

You can find the options for each command by appending `--help`:

```sh
$ avs-devnet --help
NAME:
   avs-devnet - start an AVS devnet

USAGE:
   avs-devnet [global options] command [command options]

### Context object

The *Context object* can be accessed via [Go template syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) (e.g: `{{.}}`).
Thinking of it as a nested map, items can be accessed by specifying the keys to be accessed, in order: `{{.first_key.second_key.third_key}}`
Some additional functions are also available, like `{{slice ...}}` and `{{index ...}}` (more info [here](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Functions)).

What follows is a list of the values available in the *Context object*.

#### `.http_rpc_url`

The URL of the HTTP-RPC exposed on the first node of the underlying devnet.

Example value: `http://172.16.0.9:8545`

#### `.ws_rpc_url`

The URL of the WebSocket-RPC exposed on the first node of the underlying devnet.

Example value: `ws://172.16.0.9:8546`

#### `.deployer_private_key`

The ECDSA private key used when deploying contracts.

Example value: `0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31`

#### `.deployer_address`

The address used to deploy contracts.

Example value: `0x8943545177806ED17B9F23F0a21ee5948eCaa776`

#### `.addresses.<deployment-name>.<contract-name>`

The address of the contract `<contract-name>` from deployment `<deployment-name>`.
Note that this requires the address to be declared before the template expansion.

Example value: `{{.addresses.MyAvs.serviceManager}}` expands to `0x89a37F5cd42162B56DE8A48bDe38A6E97C965675`

#### `.services.<service-name>.ip_address`

The IP address of the service `<service-name>`.
Note that this requires the service to be started before the template expansion.

Example value: `{{.services.aggregator.ip_address}}` expands to `172.16.0.70`

#### `.keys.<key-name>.address`

The Ethereum address associated to the key named `<key-name>`.
Only ECDSA keys have this property.

Example value: `0x0d7597aedfa6b73f3aac93ecfcf5abcfbcc5cd40`

#### `.keys.<key-name>.private_key`

The private key of the key named `<key-name>`.

Example value:

- ECDSA: `0xe314a391f6e0128c35573c9157baedd8381350e4efdc7e73509849a8e0b73f32`
- BLS: `11311926940818870267862834934784331525396505743635597567466859068964031983193`

#### `.keys.<key-name>.password`

The password to the keystore for the key named `<key-name>`.
Only dynamically generated keys have this property.

Example value: `jR07sE6zmoIElmwjsf7m`

## Troubleshooting

### "An API version mismatch was detected"

Sometimes the Kurtosis CLI and engine have mismatching versions.
When that happens you can fix it by updating the Kurtosis CLI via your chosen method, and restarting the engine with:

```bash
kurtosis engine restart
```

### `failed to read downloaded context: failed to load cache key: invalid response status 403` ([#145](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/avs-devnet/issues/145))

This errors happens due to [a bug in moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/47717).
It can be fixed by disabling the "Use containerd for pulling and storing images" option in Docker Desktop.

## Kurtosis package

For how to use the Kurtosis package or interact with the devnet via Kurtosis CLI, see the documentation available in [`docs/kurtosis_package.md`](./docs/kurtosis_package.md).
